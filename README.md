# InsightCodingChallenge

I was offered by Insight Data Engineering to participate in a "coding challenge" for interview screening.

At the same time I was entertaining a collaboration in Paris, attending HackTheBrain.uk and organizing an outreach presentation, but thought the challenge would be worth the effort. With that in mind, managed to write a little bit of code in C which incidentally served as a nice refresher as I haven't wrote in that language in so long.

Word Frequency and Running Median are in the same file as they use similar code philosophy.
This is obviously not ideal.

@ToDo
Separate word frequency and running median.
Remove hardcoded folders.
Syntaxic rule for words as property ?
